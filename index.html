            <p class="text">On Friday, January 27, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that barred entry in the country for anyone traveling from seven countries, regardless of visa status. A number of people who were already travelling when the order
                was signed, were detained on arrival in the US and many more were turned away at airports around the globe. </p>
            <p class="text after-first"> After actions by the courts to stop the ban, some of those travelers safely arrived in the United States. </p>
